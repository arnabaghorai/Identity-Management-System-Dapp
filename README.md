### Identity Management System
Blockchain Identity Management offers a decentralized and secure solution that puts users back in control via a distributed trust model

The existing identity management system is neither secure nor reliable. At every point, you are being asked to identify yourself through multiple government- authorized IDs like Voter ID, Passport, Pan Card and so on.

### Challenges faced by Traditional Identity Management System
- Identity theft
- A combination of usernames and passwords
- Lack of Control
